# Ⅰ Introduce

This is a repository for various popular corpora in the field of code generation/code search.

The corpus we have collected comes from these tasks: the input is natural language descriptions/UI images and the output is code snippets.

# Ⅱ Overview

We have divided the corpora into the following categories.

1. Common Programming Languages Code 
2. Domain Specific Languages Code
3. Programming Competition Code
4. Pseudo Code
5. Card Game Code
6. UI Code
7. Method Name

# Ⅲ Details

## 1. Common Programming Languages Code [[LINK](https://github.com/NTDXYG/CodeGen_Corpora/tree/main/Common_Programming_Languages_Code)] 

This category is mostly drawn from the open source community and contains several programming languages commonly used by developers.

```
Input: natural language descriptions
Output: code snippets for common programming languages
```

------

## 2. Domain Specific Languages Code [[LINK](https://github.com/NTDXYG/CodeGen_Corpora/tree/main/Domain_Specific_Languages_Code)]

This category is mostly drawn from open source communities, specific websites, and synthesis, and contains several domain-specific programming languages such as information search,regular expressions, shell code, SQL code, and formal representation code.

```
Input: natural language descriptions
Output: code snippets for domain specific languages
```

------

## 3. Programming Competition Code [[LINK](https://github.com/NTDXYG/CodeGen_Corpora/tree/main/Programming_Competition_Code)]

This category, mostly from programming websites, comes with test cases to check the correctness of the code generated, in addition to the description of the code and the code itself.

```
Input: natural language descriptions
Output: code snippets with input/output test cases
```

------

## 4. Pseudo Code [[LINK](https://github.com/NTDXYG/CodeGen_Corpora/tree/main/Pseudo_Code)]

This category mostly comes from hand-writing by developers and is based on the granularity of lines of code.

```
Input: pseudo code
Output: code (line-bu-line)
```

------

## 5. Card Game Code [[LINK](https://github.com/NTDXYG/CodeGen_Corpora/tree/main/Card_Game_Code)]

Most of this category comes from the open source community and is based on code generation for card games.

```
Input: natural language descriptions for card
Output: card game code
```

------

## 6. UI Code [[LINK](https://github.com/NTDXYG/CodeGen_Corpora/tree/main/UI_Code)]

This category mostly comes from hand-writing by developers and and is based on code generation for UI.

```
Input: UI images
Output: code
```

------

## 7. Method Name [[LINK](https://github.com/NTDXYG/CodeGen_Corpora/tree/main/Method_Name)]

Most of this category comes from the open source community and is based on code generation for method name.

```
Input: natural language descriptions
Output: method name
```
